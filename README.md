# TF-IDF-Recommender-Engine
We will be using a dataset of film metadata from the TMDB Dataset. We will first calculate the TF-IDF scores for each word in the overview. 
Then, we will use these scores to create a recommender engine that recommends films based on the words in a user's query.

# TF-IDF From Scratch
Using the data from bbc_cls.csv We build our TFIDF Vectors and pick random documents from our dataset and look at words which have the largest TF-IDF components.
